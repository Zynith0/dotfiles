I'm currently in the process of rewriting my entire config, so this repository will be a way to keep track of everything I do, and allow other people to use it! If you do end up using them, I really hope you like them!
The main features are:
- Configurations for the colemak-dh layout
- Rose-pine as a colorscheme
- Neovim with things such as autocompletion and syntax highlighting
- Ghostty as a terminal emulator
- And a lot more that I probably forgot about

My future plans are:
- [ ] Make an install script
- [ ] Make a theme switcher script
- [ ] Improve some things about my waybar config
